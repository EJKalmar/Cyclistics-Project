Capstone project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

This project was a case study done for a fictional bike share company,
Cyclistic.

The company is trying to maximize the number of annual memberships, and my team
is trying to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service
differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy
to convert casual riders into annual members.
